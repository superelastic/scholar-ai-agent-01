We review the evolution from traditional methods to modern transformer-based architectures,\ndiscussing key innovations such as attention mechanisms, pre-training strategies, and transfer learning.\nOur analysis covers major breakthroughs including BERT, GPT, and their variants, examining their impact\non various NLP tasks including text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation.\nKeywords:\ndeep learning, natural language processing, transformers, BERT, GPT\n1. Introduction\nNatural language processing has undergone a revolutionary transformation with the advent of deep learning.\nTraditional rule-based and statistical methods have given way to neural approaches that can automatically\nlearn complex patterns from large-scale data. This paradigm shift has led to unprecedented improvements\nin performance across virtually all NLP tasks.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n2. Methodology\nWe conducted a systematic review of deep learning literature in NLP from 2013 to 2023.\nOur analysis includes: (1) Architecture evolution from RNNs to Transformers, (2) Pre-training objectives\nand strategies, (3) Fine-tuning approaches for downstream tasks, and (4) Evaluation metrics and benchmarks.\n3. Results\nOur analysis reveals several key trends: (1) Transformer-based models consistently outperform\nprevious architectures, (2) Pre-training on large unlabeled corpora significantly improves downstream\nperformance, (3) Model size and training data scale show strong correlation with performance gains.\n4. Conclusion\nDeep learning has fundamentally transformed NLP, with transformer architectures establishing\nnew state-of-the-art results across all major tasks. Future research directions include improving\ncomputational efficiency, handling low-resource languages, and developing more interpretable models.\nReferences\n[1] Vaswani, A., et al. (2017).
