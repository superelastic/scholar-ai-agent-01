    "introduction": "recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35, 2, 5]. numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nrecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121 and the input for position t. this inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. recent work has achieved\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. the fundamental\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\nattention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. in all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\nin this work we propose the transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\nthe transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight p100 gpus.\n2 background\nthe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the ext",

    "conclusion": "in this work, we presented the transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\nmulti-headed self-attention.\nfor translation tasks, the transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\non recurrent or convolutional layers. on both wmt 2014 english-to-german and wmt 2014\nenglish-to-french translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. in the former task our best\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\nwe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. we\nplan to extend the transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\nsuch as images, audio and video. making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\nthe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\nacknowledgements we are grateful to nal kalchbrenner and stephan gouws for their fruitful\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.",
