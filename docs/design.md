# Product Requirements Document - Citation-Based API Design

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Scholar AI Agent  
**Type:** Academic Research Tool  
**Purpose:** AI-powered academic research assistant that analyzes papers through citation metadata, discovers citing works with abstracts, and suggests future research directions using academic APIs

## Product Vision
Create an intelligent academic research tool using PocketFlow's agentic architecture that helps researchers understand papers, discover citations with full abstracts, and identify promising research directions through API-based analysis and a coordinated multi-agent system.

## ðŸ”„ Major Design Change
**From**: PDF upload and parsing approach  
**To**: Citation-based API approach with abstract analysis  
**Rationale**: Improved reliability, structured data access, and richer citation context through abstracts

## User Stories

2. I want to discover papers that cite my work with full abstract analysis
3. I want to see what references my paper cites (bibliography analysis)
4. I want AI-generated research directions based on abstract-level understanding
5. I want the analysis presented in a clear, structured format with export options

### As a Developer
1. I want to implement the three-agent system using reliable APIs

3. I want robust error handling for API failures
4. I want comprehensive testing without PDF parsing complexity

### As an AI Assistant
1. I need clear patterns for API integration and data aggregation
2. I need to understand multi-API coordination strategies
3. I need abstract analysis patterns for research synthesis
4. I need testing approaches for API-based workflows

   - **Semantic Scholar API**: References, detailed metadata, citation contexts
   - **CrossRef API**: DOI resolution, additional metadata
   - **OpenAlex API**: Comprehensive academic database (backup)
   
   **Data Flow:**
   ```
   User Input â†’ Paper Identification â†’ Multi-API Enrichment â†’ Analysis
       â†“              â†“                      â†“                  â†“
   Title/Author    SerpAPI            Semantic Scholar      LLM Analysis
   Year/DOI        Find paper         Get references        of abstracts
                   Get citations      Get contexts
   ```

### Data Enrichment Strategy

1. **From User Input to Rich Data**
   ```
   Input: "Attention is All You Need, Vaswani et al., 2017"
   â†“
   Step 1: SerpAPI finds paper + cluster ID
   Step 2: Get 20+ citing papers with abstracts
   Step 3: Semantic Scholar gets references + contexts  
   Step 4: LLM analyzes all abstracts for patterns
   Step 5: Generate research directions with evidence
   ```
