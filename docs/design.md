# Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** claude-pocketflow  
**Type:** Template/Framework  
**Purpose:** Enable rapid development of agentic applications using AI-assisted coding tools

## Product Vision
Create a standardized template that combines PocketFlow's agentic architecture with professional Python development practices, optimized for AI-assisted development using Cursor, Claude-Code, and Task-Master.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
1. I want to quickly create new agentic applications without setting up boilerplate
2. I want clear patterns for implementing nodes and flows
3. I want comprehensive testing built into the workflow
4. I want AI assistants to understand my project structure

### As an AI Assistant
1. I need clear rules and patterns to follow when generating code
2. I need to understand the project structure and conventions
3. I need to know where to place different types of code
4. I need testing requirements to ensure code quality

## Functional Requirements

### Core Framework
1. **Node System**
   - Implement three-phase lifecycle (prep, exec, post)
   - Support both sync and async operations
   - Provide clear error handling patterns
   - Enable state sharing through store

2. **Flow System**
   - Action-based transitions between nodes
   - Support for conditional branching
   - Error recovery paths
   - Flow composition and reusability

3. **Utility Layer**
   - Standardized pattern for external service integration
   - Built-in retry and circuit breaker support
   - Connection pooling and resource management
   - Comprehensive error handling

### Development Tools
1. **Testing Framework**
   - Pytest integration with fixtures
   - Node-level unit testing utilities
   - Flow-level integration testing
   - Mock utilities for external services

2. **Code Quality**
   - Ruff for formatting and linting
   - Pyright for type checking
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - Comprehensive type hints

3. **Documentation**
   - Auto-generated API documentation
   - Example implementations
   - Developer guides
   - Architecture documentation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Nodes should execute in under 100ms for simple operations
- Support for async operations to prevent blocking
- Efficient store management to minimize memory usage
- Lazy loading of utilities

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling at all levels
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Circuit breakers for external services
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent coding patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Well-documented codebase

### Developer Experience
- Quick setup (<5 minutes)
- Clear examples and templates
- Helpful error messages
- AI-friendly documentation structure
